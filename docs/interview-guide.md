# Semi-Structured Interview Guide (Draft)

Use this guide to gather qualitative insights without steering participants toward preconceived problems. Adjust wording during the conversation to keep it natural.

## Preparation
- Participant profile: newcomer, local resident, or community organizer.
- Obtain consent to take notes; no recording unless explicitly agreed.
- Goal: understand how they currently find housing and community information, what works, what fails, and what risks matter most.

## Warm-up
1. “Can you share a bit about when you arrived in Windsor or how you interact with newcomers?”
2. “Walk me through the last time you needed to find (housing / an event / local support).”

## Core Questions
- Discovery
  - “Where did you look first? What sources felt trustworthy?”
  - “What information was missing or unreliable?”
- Decision Factors
  - “What made you choose one option over another?”
  - “How did you verify the information?”
- Pain Points
  - “Describe any moments that felt frustrating or risky.”
  - “If nothing stood out, what helped things go smoothly?”
- Desired Support
  - “What would have made the process easier?”
  - “How do you prefer to receive updates about community events?”

## Wrap-up
- “Is there anything else we didn’t cover that matters to you?”
- “Would you be open to reviewing a prototype later?”

## After the Interview
1. Summarize key quotes and observations immediately.
2. Update `docs/evidence-log.md` with insights and backlog impact.
3. Revisit feature scope—do current priorities still make sense?
4. Capture open questions for the next research activity.
