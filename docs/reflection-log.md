# Reflection Log Template

Capture short reflections after each sprint or major work session. Use the prompts below to stay honest and evidence-based.

| Date | Activity / Milestone | Intended Outcome | What Actually Happened | Why (root cause) | Adjustment / Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-08 | Backend skeleton + tests | Have API + passing tests | ✅ Achieved after clarifying imports and SQLAlchemy usage | Early failure due to missing package path; fixed by prepending project root | Add CI check later to prevent regression |

**Prompts**
- Behave: Did we follow the working agreements (stand-ups, Trello updates)?
- Know: What new information or skill did we gain?
- Act: What concrete output did we produce?
- Reflect: What will we change based on this experience?
